## What is an IP?

An IP (Internet Protocol) address serves as a unique identifier for devices on a network, facilitating communication over the internet.

### Types of IP Addresses

- **Static IP Address:** Permanent and unchanging, often used for critical equipment.
- **Dynamic IP Address:** Subject to change, commonly assigned to consumer devices like laptops and smartphones.

### Purpose of IP Addresses

IP addresses enable devices to communicate across networks, essential for tasks like accessing websites, sending emails, and streaming media.

## IPv4 vs IPv6

IPv4 and IPv6 are two versions of the Internet Protocol, differing in address formats and available addresses.

- **IPv4:** 32-bit addresses, limited to 4.3 billion, configured manually.
- **IPv6:** 128-bit addresses, vast address space, supports auto-configuration.

## TCP/IP

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) governs communication between computers on a network, comprising multiple layers for data transmission.

## Difference between TCP and IP

While IP handles addressing, TCP ensures reliable data delivery once the destination is identified.

## How TCP/IP Works

TCP/IP operates through layers, each with specific functions:
1. Datalink Layer
2. Internet Layer
3. Transport Layer
4. Application Layer

## Understanding Switches

Switches connect devices within a LAN, forwarding data only to the intended recipients.

## Insight into Routers

Routers facilitate traffic management between networks, directing data packets to their destinations efficiently.

## Modem vs Router

A modem connects networks to the internet, while a router manages internal network traffic.

## Exploring Loopback Addresses

Loopback addresses, starting from 127.0.0.0, allow devices to send and receive data packets locally, often used for testing and debugging.

## Unraveling Subnets

Subnets divide large networks into smaller, efficient segments, enhancing network performance.

## Calculating Subnet Masks

Learn how to calculate subnet masks step-by-step for efficient network management.

## Command Line Utility: ipcalc

Explore the `ipcalc` command-line utility to further enhance your understanding of address manipulation.

I hope this guide enriches your knowledge of networking essentials and aids you in your journey through system administration. Happy learning! ðŸš€ðŸ˜Š
